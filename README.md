# Pizza Ordering Application

## Project Overview

This project is a console-based pizza ordering application written in C. Users can navigate through a menu, choose different types of pizzas, add them to the cart, and view the cart contents.

## Features

### To-Do

1. **Dynamic Pricing:**
   - [ ] Implement dynamic pricing for pizzas based on their type.

2. **Remove Magic Numbers:**
   - [ ] Replace magic numbers with named constants for better code readability.

3. **User-Friendly Output:**
   - [ ] Enhance user experience with more descriptive and user-friendly output messages.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - [ ] Implement error handling for invalid inputs to make the program more robust.

5. **Remove Global Variables:**
   - [ ] Encapsulate variables within functions rather than using global variables.

6. **File Handling:**
   - [ ] Implement file handling to save and load the cart data between sessions.

7. **Interactive Confirmation:**
   - [ ] Ask for confirmation from the user before finalizing the order.

8. **Order Summary:**
   - [ ] Provide a summary of the order at the end, including the total cost.

9. **Additional Features:**
   - [ ] Implement additional features like removing items from the cart, modifying quantities, or customizing pizzas.

10. **User Authentication:**
    - [ ] Consider adding user authentication for personalized experiences.

### Completed

1. **Structure:**
   - [x] Use a linked list to represent the cart.

2. **Menus:**
   - [x] Organize menus with separate functions (`mainMenu()`, `vegMenu()`, `nonVegMenu()`).

3. **User Interaction:**
   - [x] Implement user input and choices using `switch` statements.

## Usage

1. Compile the code using a C compiler.
2. Run the executable to start the pizza ordering application.
